## Use Templates for Similar, Repeating Transactions

### Why Use Templates?
As an agent, you will do many transactions that require the same forms and
some of the same information. Why start from scratch every time?

Templates not only remind you of the required forms, they help standardize
your business practices. When you are writing up that offer at 10 pm, your
templates can help remind you of things you might otherwise miss.

### Template Types
When you set up templates, you will select the transaction type. Some examples of transaction types include, Residential Purchase, Property Management Agreement,

Each template then includes all of the forms that may be required
for the transaction type you are doing. Once you add all of the documents you need for a template, you can then review each form to see what preset content you want.

For example:
1. Residential Listing
2. Residential Purchase
3. Residential Property Management Agreement
4. Residential Property Management Listing
5. Residential Lease Agreement
